Script: gen_snpfile.pl

This Perl script has been tested in Linux OS (Centos 7) using Perl version v5.16.3.
The aim of this script is to read a GWAS summary statistics file and generate a list of lead variants and annotate them with nearest gene names.
To be used as "snpfile" for Manhattan++

The script uses a gene database that can be downloaded from PLINK website:
https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/resources#genelist

The summary statistics file can be plain text file or gzipped (tab delimited).
The summary statistics file must have at least the following columns (with headers)
[Required] Column name containing chromosome numbers (numeric)
[Required] Column name containing variant names
[Required] Column name having variant positions (basepairs)
[Required] Column name having variant p-values (not log10 transformed)
[Required] Column name having variant beta values (not Odds Ratios)
[Required] Column name having variant effect allele frequency

For help, run:
perl gen_snpfile.pl --help

The script defines a locus if 2 variants are at least 500 kbp apart or defined using --locusbounds and have p<5e-8 or defined using --gwaspcut.

The script annotates the lead variant with gene names based on proximity to nearest gene. 
 - If gene is beyond 500kbp (or defined using --snpgenebounds)  apart either side, the variant is in a gene-desert.
 - If variant is within a gene start-end, the variant gets that gene annotation
 - If the variant is between 2 genes, the 2 nearest genes are reported for that variant
 - If the variant is between 2 genes and one gene is further than --snpgenebounds, only the nearest 3' or 5' gene is reported


*****************
IMPORTANT
****************

The user still need to update the output file to identify the loci that are novel.
